## Integration with DeFi Protocols

### Access Control Integration

Each DeFi protocol integrates with the KYC system to enforce compliance:

```move
// Example AMM integration
public entry fun swap_tokens(
    account: &signer,
    amount_in: u64,
    min_amount_out: u64
) acquires LiquidityPool {
    let user_address = signer::address_of(account);
    
    // Check KYC compliance
    assert!(
        kyc_did_registry::check_kyc_compliance(
            user_address,
            KYC_LEVEL_BASIC,
            string::utf8(b"token_swap")
        ),
        E_KYC_NOT_COMPLIANT
    );
    
    // Proceed with swap
    execute_swap(user_address, amount_in, min_amount_out);
}
```

### Transaction Limits Enforcement

```move
// Dynamic limit checking based on KYC level
public fun check_transaction_limits(
    user_address: address,
    amount: u64,
    operation_type: String
): bool {
    let (kyc_level, _, _, _, _, _, _) = 
        kyc_did_registry::get_kyc_profile(user_address);
    
    let daily_limit = get_daily_limit(kyc_level);
    let current_daily_volume = get_user_daily_volume(user_address);
    
    (current_daily_volume + amount) <= daily_limit
}
```
